GCA_013046825.1 was published 2019 and is a draft genome of Turicibacter sanguinis, strain: DSM 14220
Maki et al 2020 sequences the same strain (albeit with different name: MOL361) and published a genome assembly https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7303409/
with the accession ID: GCA_013046825.1
Let's use this insead of the missing genome GCA_004338625.1
